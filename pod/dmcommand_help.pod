=head1 Deliantra Dungeon Master Commands

The following commands are only available to you if you are dungeon
master, that is, a kind of server administrator with special privileges.

=head2 abil

   abil <player> <attribute> <value> 

B<abil> will permanently change the ability scores of players. Attribute is
one of str, dex, con, int, wis, pow, cha. Value may not exceed 30.

=head2 addexp

   addexp <player> <how much> 

The player must have a skill readied. All experience added in this manner
will go directly to the skill readied.

=head2 arrest

   arrest <player>

Puts the named player into the nearest cell (corresonding to the region he is in).

=head2 banish

   banish <player> 

I<Kicks> the named player and adds their current IP address to the banish
file.  This will prevent the named player from logging into the server
(from their current IP). This is an in-game version of the ban function
meant for short term relief of persistant goons and for DMs who do not
have shell access. It is probably a good idea to clear out the banish file
(usually at F</var/crossfire/banish_file>) on a regular basis and delete
or move any entries to the ban_file if desired.

=head2 create

   create <number> <bonus> <archtype> <variable1> <value1> <variable2> <value2> ...  

Creating items is rather dangerous and tends to crash the server when
creating some items.

The number and bonus attributes may be left off, or the bonus itself may
be left off any time.  If a bonus is desired, number must be specified as
well.  Archtype must be specified in all cases. Variable and values may be
left off at any time, but specifiying a variable requires a value also be
specified.

Multipart values such as for an item name must be quoted.

Example:

   create 5 +1 sword name "Spiffy Sword" face chicken.171

This would create 5 +1 longswords named 'Spiffy Sword' that look like
chickens. See also: patch, dump

=head2 debug

   debug <level> 

Without arguments, debug will simply print the current level of
debugging. Valid debugging levels are 0-3 where: llevError = 0, llevInfo =
1, llevDebug = 2, llevMonster = 3

=head2 dm

   dm <password>

Try to become dungeon master.

=head2 dmhide

   dmhide <password>

Same as becoming dm and hiding at the same time. See B<hide>.

=head2 dump

   dump <tag> 

Using dump, you can see the attributes of any item in the game.  To find
the object number of an item you wish to view, click on it. If this item
is in your inventory, or you are standing over, click on yourself and the
item tags will be displayed. see also: patch

=head2 goto

Using this command will instantly move you to the start point of the map
and position specified. If the position is omitted, the map entry point
will be used instead.

=head2 hide

   hide

This hides the DM from being seen by other players.  This is done by
making the player perpetually invisible.  It also results in the player
not showing up in the who command, maps comamnd, or being reported as a
player on the metaserver.

Note that the DM can still do things that makes his presence known, eg,
shout, other DM actions, etc.

=head2 insert_into

This will insert the 2nd item in the first.  2nd can't be a player.

=head2 invisible

argument, it will kick all players off the server with the exception of
you.

=head2 learn_special_prayer

   learn_special_prayer <prayer name>

this will allow you to permanently learn a spell as a special prayer of
your god. see also: learn_spell

=head2 learn_spell

   learn_spell <spell name>

This will allow you to permanently learn a spell. <spell name> may be a
partial spell name.

It is similar to learn_special_prayer except that you will retain
knowledge of this spell regardless of changing dieties. see also:
learn_special_prayer

=head2 mon_aggr

   mon_aggr

=head2 nowiz

   nodm or nowiz

objects in the game. Simply specify the object to modify and the new
values of its variables (or completely new variables).  See Also: dump

=head2 reload

Will first unload all loaded perl extensions and modules loaded from the
extension directory, followed by loading the perl part of the plugin and
all extensions found.

This is done in an as atomic way as possible so it is safe to do at
anytime, but it will freeze the swerver for multiple seconds.

=head2 possess

   possess <tag>

Take over the body of a given monster. It is not suggested you try to
possess another player, as bad things will undoubtably happen. Allows DM
